            When I came on board, the production sites were written in PHP without the use of a
            framework; SQL queries were interspersed in the code; there was no testing of any kind,
            updates to production sites were done via FTP upload, and people were using
            Dreamweaver to code. In the course of my employment, I brought over significant
            changes to the process of web development & maintenance. I was instrumental in
            rewriting the most-visited site (http://clomedia.com) into a modern MVC pattern, using
            industry-wide standards such as TDD, agile methodology, and ORM.
